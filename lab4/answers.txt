# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)

We used a fork. The child process executes the download or upload, which happen in no particular order.
We didn't run into any performance problems, but a DoS attack on the network is easily possible because we don't cap the number of simultaneous downloads and uploads.

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

On the upload:
Snscanf - tries to copy up to t->tail, may create a problem when we pass in a number greater than 256.
	Fix: Put an if statement before the call. If it's greater than MAXFILESIZ, exit with an error.

On the download:
Strcpy -- Good old strcpy problems on the download
	Fix: Switch to strncpy, taking in the FILENAMESIZ as the third parameter.

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)

Changing directories: If we find a '/' using strchr, we throw an error and exit.
Download rate: If it's too damn small, we cut off the connection, jumping to try_again.
Resource Consumption: If we try to write a file that's bigger than my arbitrary 1 GB Limit, it will stop.

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)

# Extra credit problems
#Extra credit problem: none

# Add any other information you'd like us to know below this line.
